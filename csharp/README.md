# C#
>C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative, and later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2018). Mono is the name of the free and open-source project to develop a compiler and runtime for the language. C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI).

## Installing C#
If C# isn't already available on your system, follow the instructions found at the official [Visual Studio site](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) to install it on your computer.  

Alternatively, I recommend installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) instead by:
- Downloading and executing the [Visual Studio Code installer](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- Installing the [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)

## Running the tests
The DotNet framework can easily execute all tests in a file by executing the `$ dotnet test` command from the test file's directory where the test file resides.

If you want to execute all tests on a particular file, the command accepts a path as a parameter: `$ dotnet test <filename>Test.cs`.
