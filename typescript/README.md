# TypeScript
>TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language.
>
>TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js or Deno).
>
>There are multiple options available for transcompilation. Either the default TypeScript Checker can be used, or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.

## Installing TypeScript
If TypeScript isn't already available on your system, follow the instructions found at the official [TypeScript site](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to install it on your computer.  

Alternatively, Exercism recommends installing [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead by:
- Downloading and executing the [*msi* file](https://yarnpkg.com/latest.msi)
- Executing the console command `$ yarn install`

## Running the tests
Yarn can easily execute all tests in a file by executing the `yarn test` command from the test file's directory where the `package.json` file resides.

If you want to execute all tests on a particular file, the command accepts a path as a parameter: `yarn test <filename>.test.ts`.
