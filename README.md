# Exercism
This repository contains my solutions to the exercises found on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/) tracks.

> Exercism aims to provide opportunity for people of all backgrounds by helping them develop their programming skills through practice and mentorship. We provide thousands of exercises spread across over 50 language tracks, and offer both automated and human mentoring. 
> 
> Our current platform is targeted at people with some programming experience who want to deepen their knowledge or learn new languages. In time, we will also offer support for total beginners.

## Installing the CLI
Exercism makes use of a CLI to download and submit exercises to their website.
The installation process can be found [here](https://exercism.io/cli-walkthrough).

Once installed, the CLI needs to be configured by running the following command (using your [API token](https://exercism.io/my/settings)):  
`exercism configure --token=YOUR_API_TOKEN`

Note: you might need to configure the workspace in order to upload files from a custom location instead of the default directory; this can be achieved by executing the following command:  
`exercism configure --workspace="<path>"`
